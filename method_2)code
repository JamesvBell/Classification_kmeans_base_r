rm(list = ls())


#Take data that has no categories and group them with kmeans

x <- rbind(matrix(rnorm(100, sd = 0.3), ncol = 2), 
      matrix(rnorm(100, mean = 1, sd = 0.3), ncol = 2))

#let's take a look at this in a plot
plot(x)


#let's split it into 2 groups
cl <-  kmeans(x, 2)

#Now let's look at our 2 groups

#let's print out the center's of our 2 groups. Whichever center a new point is
#closest to will determine which group a new data point belongs to.
